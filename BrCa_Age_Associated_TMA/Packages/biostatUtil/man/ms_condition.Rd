\title{Sample count condition for MS analyses}
\usage{
ms_condition(data, treatment, control = NULL, condition = c("VC",
  "MRC", "MC"))
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{The data matrix with rows as observations, columns as variables}

\item{treatment}{A character vector indicating how different treatment groups
are coded. Regular expression is used on the column names to find all
relevant treatment variables.}

\item{control}{Optionally specify a character string indicating the control
group if it exists. Regular expression is used on the column names to find
all relevant control variables.}

\item{condition}{Either one of "VC" (default), "MRC", or "MC". See details.}
}
\value{
A logical vector of length equal to the number of rows in
\code{data}, indicating which observations are kept and which are to be
removed.
}
\description{
The number of non-missing samples per treatment group determine whether it
can be used in subsequent analyses.
}
\details{
The Variance Condition (VC) (default) requires at least two non-missing
samples in each of the treatment groups. A rudimentary estimate of variance
is possible when this phenomenon exists. The Minimum Reasonable Condition
(MRC) requires all treatment groups to have at least one non-missing sample
and one treatment group to have at least two non-missing samples. Equal
variance assumption is used in the case of MRC. Finally, the Minimum
Condition (MC) requires at least one non-missing sample in each of the
treatment groups. MC is not generally suggested in practice.

Additionally, if there are controls, they are handled by MC.

# Example data matrix with some missing sample values
g <- c("X5", "X19")
r <- c("1", "2", "3")
col.nm <- sort(apply(expand.grid(g, r), 1, paste, collapse = "_"))
A <- matrix(c(seq_len(36)), ncol = 6, byrow = FALSE, dimnames = list(NULL, col.nm))
A[c(1, 21, 26, 7, 17, 8, 23, 4, 16, 19, 5, 25, 12, 18, 24)] <- NA

# Two treatment experimental design
ms_condition(A, treatment = c("X19", "X5"), condition = "VC")
ms_condition(A, treatment = c("X19", "X5"), condition = "MRC")
ms_condition(A, treatment = c("X19", "X5"), condition = "MC")

# Control ends in "_1", Treatments ends in "_2", "_3"
ms_condition(A, treatment = c("_2", "_3"), control = "_1", condition = "VC")
ms_condition(A, treatment = c("_2", "_3"), control = "_1", condition = "MRC")
