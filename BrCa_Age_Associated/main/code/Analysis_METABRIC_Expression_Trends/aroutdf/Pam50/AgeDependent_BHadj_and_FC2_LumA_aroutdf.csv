Organs are commonly observed as visibly distinct structures, but may also exist as loosely associated clusters of cells that work together to perform a specific function or functions [goid 9887] [pmid 7961765] [evidence TAS]","Interacting selectively with any protein or protein complex (a complex of two or more proteins that may include other nonprotein molecules) [goid 5515] [evidence IEA]","PGII; DSPG2; CSCD; PGS2; SLRR1B; PG40","PGII; DSPG2; CSCD; PGS2; SLRR1B; PG40","ILMN_2347145",-0.00976733281352905,-0.0191854224780868,-0.0224222312069307,0.219623209189464,0.00892353282493859,6.15514343014894e-13,1,0.700311759429822,0.174861464221661,1.98933420411628e-10,TRUE,TRUE,-0.341856648473517,-0.671489786733036,-1.56955618448515,-1.56955618448515,1.98933420411628e-10,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

An organ is defined as a tissue or set of tissues that work together to perform a specific function or functions. Morphogenesis is the process by which anatomical structures are generated and organized. Organs are commonly observed as visibly distinct structures, but may also exist as loosely associated clusters of cells that work together to perform a specific function or functions [goid 9887] [pmid 7961765] [evidence TAS]","Interacting selectively with any protein or protein complex (a complex of two or more proteins that may include other nonprotein molecules) [goid 5515] [evidence IEA]","PGII; DSPG2; CSCD; PGS2; SLRR1B; PG40","PGII; DSPG2; CSCD; PGS2; SLRR1B; PG40","ILMN_1768227",-0.0243591841598894,-0.0070087633525629,-0.0296502013222871,0.0583915316246363,0.494641208254174,9.2248311610076e-11,1,0.459181746354677,0.822537118143675,1.56863914686639e-08,TRUE,TRUE,-0.852571445596129,-0.245306717339702,-2.07551409256009,-2.07551409256009,1.56863914686639e-08,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

The Golgi apparatus differs from the endoplasmic reticulum in often having slightly thicker membranes, appearing in sections as a characteristic shallow semicircle so that the convex side (cis or entry face) abuts the endoplasmic reticulum, secretory vesicles emerging from the concave side (trans or exit face). In vertebrate cells there is usually one such organelle, while in invertebrates and plants, where they are known usually as dictyosomes, there may be several scattered in the cytoplasm. The Golgi apparatus processes proteins produced on the ribosomes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum; such processing includes modification of the core oligosaccharides of glycoproteins, and the sorting and packaging of proteins for transport to a variety of cellular locations.

The Golgi apparatus processes proteins produced on the ribosomes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum; such processing includes modification of the core oligosaccharides of glycoproteins, and the sorting and packaging of proteins for transport to a variety of cellular locations.
