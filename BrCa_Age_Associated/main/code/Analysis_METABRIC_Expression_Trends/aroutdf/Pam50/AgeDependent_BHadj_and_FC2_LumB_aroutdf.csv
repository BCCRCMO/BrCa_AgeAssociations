Organs are commonly observed as visibly distinct structures, but may also exist as loosely associated clusters of cells that work together to perform a specific function or functions [goid 9887] [pmid 7961765] [evidence TAS]","Interacting selectively with any protein or protein complex (a complex of two or more proteins that may include other nonprotein molecules) [goid 5515] [evidence IEA]","PGII; DSPG2; CSCD; PGS2; SLRR1B; PG40","PGII; DSPG2; CSCD; PGS2; SLRR1B; PG40","ILMN_2347145",-0.0406887015658036,-0.0159068085709282,-0.0186667140303123,0.0185364285910081,0.0891295815080155,0.000283521563990192,0,0.418499632553068,0.61931103119052,0.00968956784832867,TRUE,TRUE,-1.42410455480313,-0.556738299982486,-1.30666998212186,-1.30666998212186,0.00968956784832867,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

In some species, or in specialized cell types, RNA metabolism or DNA replication may be absent [goid 5634] [evidence IEA]; RNA polymerase II, one of three nuclear DNA-directed RNA polymerases found in all eukaryotes, is a multisubunit complex; typically it produces mRNAs, snoRNAs, and some of the snRNAs. Two large subunits comprise the most conserved portion including the catalytic site and share similarity with other eukaryotic and bacterial multisubunit RNA polymerases. The largest subunit of RNA polymerase II contains an essential carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) composed of a variable number of heptapeptide repeats (YSPTSPS). The remainder of the complex is composed of smaller subunits (generally ten or more), some of which are also found in RNA polymerases I and III.

The Golgi apparatus differs from the endoplasmic reticulum in often having slightly thicker membranes, appearing in sections as a characteristic shallow semicircle so that the convex side (cis or entry face) abuts the endoplasmic reticulum, secretory vesicles emerging from the concave side (trans or exit face). In vertebrate cells there is usually one such organelle, while in invertebrates and plants, where they are known usually as dictyosomes, there may be several scattered in the cytoplasm. The Golgi apparatus processes proteins produced on the ribosomes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum; such processing includes modification of the core oligosaccharides of glycoproteins, and the sorting and packaging of proteins for transport to a variety of cellular locations. Three different regions of the Golgi are now recognized both in terms of structure and function: cis, in the vicinity of the cis face, trans, in the vicinity of the trans face, and medial, lying between the cis and trans regions [goid 5794] [pmid 18029348] [evidence IDA]; The living contents of a cell; the matter contained within (but not including) the plasma membrane, usually taken to exclude large vacuoles and masses of secretory or ingested material.
