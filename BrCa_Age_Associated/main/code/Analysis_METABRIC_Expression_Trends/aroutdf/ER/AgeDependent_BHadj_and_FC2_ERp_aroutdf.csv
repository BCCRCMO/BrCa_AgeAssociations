The Golgi apparatus differs from the endoplasmic reticulum in often having slightly thicker membranes, appearing in sections as a characteristic shallow semicircle so that the convex side (cis or entry face) abuts the endoplasmic reticulum, secretory vesicles emerging from the concave side (trans or exit face). In vertebrate cells there is usually one such organelle, while in invertebrates and plants, where they are known usually as dictyosomes, there may be several scattered in the cytoplasm. The Golgi apparatus processes proteins produced on the ribosomes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum; such processing includes modification of the core oligosaccharides of glycoproteins, and the sorting and packaging of proteins for transport to a variety of cellular locations. Three different regions of the Golgi are now recognized both in terms of structure and function: cis, in the vicinity of the cis face, trans, in the vicinity of the trans face, and medial, lying between the cis and trans regions [goid 5794] [pmid 11256614] [evidence IDA]; Double layer of lipid molecules that encloses all cells, and, in eukaryotes, many organelles; may be a single or double lipid bilayer; also includes associated proteins [goid 16020] [evidence IEA]; Penetrating at least one phospholipid bilayer of a membrane.

Organs are commonly observed as visibly distinct structures, but may also exist as loosely associated clusters of cells that work together to perform a specific function or functions [goid 9887] [pmid 7961765] [evidence TAS]","Interacting selectively with any protein or protein complex (a complex of two or more proteins that may include other nonprotein molecules) [goid 5515] [evidence IEA]","PGII; DSPG2; CSCD; PGS2; SLRR1B; PG40","PGII; DSPG2; CSCD; PGS2; SLRR1B; PG40","ILMN_2347145",-0.0195422057499205,-0.0204857668082042,-0.0222138798446652,0.00494202694576252,0.000229413785355177,9.81540822910922e-19,1,0.154894251393014,0.0121300985554591,2.57538369787751e-16,TRUE,TRUE,-0.683977201247216,-0.717001838287147,-1.55497158912657,-1.55497158912657,2.57538369787751e-16,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

About 40 different lysosomal hydrolases are known and lysosomes have a great variety of morphologies and functions [goid 5764] [pmid 3029062] [evidence TAS]; A compound membranous cytoplasmic organelle of eukaryotic cells, consisting of flattened, ribosome-free vesicles arranged in a more or less regular stack. The Golgi apparatus differs from the endoplasmic reticulum in often having slightly thicker membranes, appearing in sections as a characteristic shallow semicircle so that the convex side (cis or entry face) abuts the endoplasmic reticulum, secretory vesicles emerging from the concave side (trans or exit face). In vertebrate cells there is usually one such organelle, while in invertebrates and plants, where they are known usually as dictyosomes, there may be several scattered in the cytoplasm. The Golgi apparatus processes proteins produced on the ribosomes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum; such processing includes modification of the core oligosaccharides of glycoproteins, and the sorting and packaging of proteins for transport to a variety of cellular locations. Three different regions of the Golgi are now recognized both in terms of structure and function: cis, in the vicinity of the cis face, trans, in the vicinity of the trans face, and medial, lying between the cis and trans regions [goid 5794] [pmid 1332979] [evidence IMP]","The chemical reactions and pathways, including anabolism and catabolism, by which living organisms transform chemical substances.

An organ is defined as a tissue or set of tissues that work together to perform a specific function or functions. Morphogenesis is the process by which anatomical structures are generated and organized. Organs are commonly observed as visibly distinct structures, but may also exist as loosely associated clusters of cells that work together to perform a specific function or functions [goid 9887] [pmid 7961765] [evidence TAS]","Interacting selectively with any protein or protein complex (a complex of two or more proteins that may include other nonprotein molecules) [goid 5515] [evidence IEA]","PGII; DSPG2; CSCD; PGS2; SLRR1B; PG40","PGII; DSPG2; CSCD; PGS2; SLRR1B; PG40","ILMN_1768227",-0.025626832894923,-0.0126171630058908,-0.0270121230492302,0.00822099364546225,0.0931681196501652,4.02145691707916e-15,1,0.189595491291104,0.35258028597707,5.31867647491095e-13,TRUE,TRUE,-0.896939151322304,-0.441600705206178,-1.89084861344611,-1.89084861344611,5.31867647491095e-13,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

Secondary active transport is catalysis of the transfer of a solute from one side of a membrane to the other, up its concentration gradient. The transporter binds the solute and undergoes a series of conformational changes. Transport works equally well in either direction and is driven by a chemiosmotic source of energy. Chemiosmotic sources of energy include uniport, symport or antiport [goid 8271] [evidence IEA]; Enables the active transport of a solute across a membrane by a mechanism whereby two or more species are transported in opposite directions in a tightly coupled process not directly linked to a form of energy other than chemiosmotic energy [goid 15297] [evidence IEA]; Interacting selectively with chloride ions (Cl-) [goid 31404] [evidence IEA]","CLD; DRA","CLD; DRA","ILMN_1760087",-0.02633367144013,-0.00630917880461089,-0.0195644269096958,0.00107961145889563,0.114252606353233,7.23640488960559e-18,1,0.0761571496654442,0.390439741464661,1.67373586648067e-15,TRUE,TRUE,-0.92167850040455,-0.220821258161381,-1.3695098836787,-1.3695098836787,1.67373586648067e-15,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

The Golgi apparatus differs from the endoplasmic reticulum in often having slightly thicker membranes, appearing in sections as a characteristic shallow semicircle so that the convex side (cis or entry face) abuts the endoplasmic reticulum, secretory vesicles emerging from the concave side (trans or exit face). In vertebrate cells there is usually one such organelle, while in invertebrates and plants, where they are known usually as dictyosomes, there may be several scattered in the cytoplasm. The Golgi apparatus processes proteins produced on the ribosomes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum; such processing includes modification of the core oligosaccharides of glycoproteins, and the sorting and packaging of proteins for transport to a variety of cellular locations.
