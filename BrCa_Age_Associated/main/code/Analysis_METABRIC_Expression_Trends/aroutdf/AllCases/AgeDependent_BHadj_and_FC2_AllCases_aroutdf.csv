For cells without external protective or external encapsulating structures this refers to space outside of the plasma membrane. This term covers the host cell environment outside an intracellular parasite [goid 5576] [evidence IEA]; A compound membranous cytoplasmic organelle of eukaryotic cells, consisting of flattened, ribosome-free vesicles arranged in a more or less regular stack. The Golgi apparatus differs from the endoplasmic reticulum in often having slightly thicker membranes, appearing in sections as a characteristic shallow semicircle so that the convex side (cis or entry face) abuts the endoplasmic reticulum, secretory vesicles emerging from the concave side (trans or exit face). In vertebrate cells there is usually one such organelle, while in invertebrates and plants, where they are known usually as dictyosomes, there may be several scattered in the cytoplasm. The Golgi apparatus processes proteins produced on the ribosomes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum; such processing includes modification of the core oligosaccharides of glycoproteins, and the sorting and packaging of proteins for transport to a variety of cellular locations. Three different regions of the Golgi are now recognized both in terms of structure and function: cis, in the vicinity of the cis face, trans, in the vicinity of the trans face, and medial, lying between the cis and trans regions [goid 5794] [evidence IEA]; Double layer of lipid molecules that encloses all cells, and, in eukaryotes, many organelles; may be a single or double lipid bilayer; also includes associated proteins [goid 16020] [evidence IEA]",NA,NA,"GLIPR2; GAPR-1","GLIPR2; GAPR-1","ILMN_1652631",-0.0167749090718224,-0.0142043537204771,-0.0149765095532611,1.5282972397501e-06,2.84244136455415e-05,4.29866204960361e-27,1,8.58291026369667e-05,0.00199596641603362,7.94650015177292e-25,TRUE,TRUE,-0.587121817513785,-0.497152380216697,-1.04835566872828,-1.04835566872828,7.94650015177292e-25,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

In vertebrate cells there is usually one such organelle, while in invertebrates and plants, where they are known usually as dictyosomes, there may be several scattered in the cytoplasm. The Golgi apparatus processes proteins produced on the ribosomes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum; such processing includes modification of the core oligosaccharides of glycoproteins, and the sorting and packaging of proteins for transport to a variety of cellular locations.

An organ is defined as a tissue or set of tissues that work together to perform a specific function or functions. Morphogenesis is the process by which anatomical structures are generated and organized. Organs are commonly observed as visibly distinct structures, but may also exist as loosely associated clusters of cells that work together to perform a specific function or functions [goid 9887] [pmid 10993894] [evidence NAS]","Interacting selectively with monomeric or multimeric forms of actin, including actin filaments [goid 3779] [evidence IEA]; Interacting selectively with profilin, an actin-binding protein that forms a complex with G-actin and prevents it from polymerizing to form F-actin [goid 5522] [evidence ISS]; Interacting selectively with a SH3 domain (Src homology 3) of a protein, small protein modules containing approximately 50 amino acid residues found in a great variety of intracellular or membrane-associated proteins [goid 17124] [evidence ISS]","RNB6","RNB6","ILMN_1730622",0.0199489330863674,0.00777457468623282,0.0143272768937174,1.00783996384587e-05,0.0727976687919662,8.03167050592355e-16,1,0.000356417490982392,0.261442683792356,2.72012224636077e-14,TRUE,TRUE,0.69821265802286,0.272110114018149,1.00290938256022,1.00290938256022,2.72012224636077e-14,TRUE,FALSE,TRUE

An organ is defined as a tissue or set of tissues that work together to perform a specific function or functions. Morphogenesis is the process by which anatomical structures are generated and organized. Organs are commonly observed as visibly distinct structures, but may also exist as loosely associated clusters of cells that work together to perform a specific function or functions [goid 9887] [pmid 9364936] [evidence TAS]; Any process involved directly in viral genome replication, including viral nucleotide metabolism [goid 19079] [pmid 10985244] [evidence TAS]; Any series of molecular signals generated as a consequence of a cytokine or chemokine binding to a cell surface receptor [goid 19221] [pmid 12207323] [evidence IDA]; The movement of a macrophage in response to an external stimulus [goid 48246] [pmid 12207323] [evidence IDA]","Interacting selectively with a G-protein-coupled receptor [goid 1664] [evidence IEA]; Catalysis of the phosphorylation of an amino acid residue in a protein, usually according to the reaction: a protein + ATP = a phosphoprotein + ADP [goid 4672] [pmid 9973507] [evidence TAS]; Mediates the transfer of a signal from the outside to the inside of a cell by means other than the introduction of the signal molecule itself into the cell [goid 4871] [pmid 10198043] [evidence TAS]; Mediates the transfer of a signal from the outside to the inside of a cell by means other than the introduction of the signal molecule itself into the cell [goid 4871] [pmid 10770925] [evidence TAS]; The function of a family of chemotactic pro-inflammatory activation-inducible cytokines acting primarily upon hemopoietic cells in immunoregulatory processes; all chemokines possess a number of conserved cysteine residues involved in intramolecular disulfide bond formation [goid 8009] [pmid 10623817] [evidence TAS]","SMC-CF; MCP1; MCAF; HSMCR30; GDCF-2; SCYA2; HC11; MGC9434; MCP-1; GDCF-2 HC11","SMC-CF; MCP1; MCAF; HSMCR30; GDCF-2; SCYA2; HC11; MGC9434; MCP-1; GDCF-2 HC11","ILMN_1720048",-0.0116874090254718,-0.0149344696960296,-0.0150812600272841,0.0143369388655446,0.00196260730829768,6.60154235036451e-15,1,0.0978160626840632,0.0285798805884737,1.96568072803441e-13,TRUE,TRUE,-0.409059315891514,-0.522706439361036,-1.05568820190989,-1.05568820190989,1.96568072803441e-13,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE

Force generation involves a chemo-mechanical energy conversion step. The chemo-mechanical energy conversion step is carried out by the actin/myosin complex activity, which generates force through ATP hydrolysis. Smooth muscle differs from striated muscle in the much higher actin/myosin ratio, the absence of conspicuous sarcomeres and the ability to contract to a much smaller fraction of its resting length [goid 6939] [evidence NAS]; The series of molecular signals generated as a consequence of a peptide neurotransmitter binding to a cell surface receptor [goid 7218] [evidence IEA]; The process whose specific outcome is the progression of nervous tissue over time, from its formation to its mature state [goid 7399] [evidence IEA]; The regulated release of proinsulin from secretory granules (B granules) in the B cells of the pancreas; accompanied by cleavage of proinsulin to form mature insulin [goid 30073] [pmid 1370155] [evidence NAS]; The regulated release of growth hormone from secretory granules into the blood [goid 30252] [evidence NAS]","The action characteristic of a neuropeptide hormone, any peptide hormone that acts in the central nervous system. A neuropeptide is any of several types of molecules found in brain tissue, composed of short chains of amino acids; they include endorphins, enkephalins, vasopressin, and others. They are often localized in axon terminals at synapses and are classified as putative neurotransmitters, although some are also hormones [goid 5184] [pmid 1722333] [evidence NAS]","GALN; GMAP; GLNN; MGC40167","GALN; GMAP; GLNN; MGC40167","ILMN_1682015",-0.023518279050221,-0.0108044153113075,-0.0149757155546993,4.88970608976424e-08,0.00495386105559539,4.77780881249709e-20,1,6.21438349736366e-06,0.0505569387486871,3.08427782376052e-18,TRUE,TRUE,-0.823139766757734,-0.378154535895762,-1.04830008882895,-1.04830008882895,3.08427782376052e-18,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
