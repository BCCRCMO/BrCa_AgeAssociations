The Golgi apparatus differs from the endoplasmic reticulum in often having slightly thicker membranes, appearing in sections as a characteristic shallow semicircle so that the convex side (cis or entry face) abuts the endoplasmic reticulum, secretory vesicles emerging from the concave side (trans or exit face). In vertebrate cells there is usually one such organelle, while in invertebrates and plants, where they are known usually as dictyosomes, there may be several scattered in the cytoplasm. The Golgi apparatus processes proteins produced on the ribosomes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum; such processing includes modification of the core oligosaccharides of glycoproteins, and the sorting and packaging of proteins for transport to a variety of cellular locations. Three different regions of the Golgi are now recognized both in terms of structure and function: cis, in the vicinity of the cis face, trans, in the vicinity of the trans face, and medial, lying between the cis and trans regions [goid 5794] [evidence IEA]; Double layer of lipid molecules that encloses all cells, and, in eukaryotes, many organelles; may be a single or double lipid bilayer; also includes associated proteins [goid 16020] [evidence IEA]; Penetrating at least one phospholipid bilayer of a membrane.

The Golgi apparatus differs from the endoplasmic reticulum in often having slightly thicker membranes, appearing in sections as a characteristic shallow semicircle so that the convex side (cis or entry face) abuts the endoplasmic reticulum, secretory vesicles emerging from the concave side (trans or exit face). In vertebrate cells there is usually one such organelle, while in invertebrates and plants, where they are known usually as dictyosomes, there may be several scattered in the cytoplasm. The Golgi apparatus processes proteins produced on the ribosomes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum; such processing includes modification of the core oligosaccharides of glycoproteins, and the sorting and packaging of proteins for transport to a variety of cellular locations.

The muscle is an organ consisting of a tissue made up of various elongated cells that are specialized to contract and thus to produce movement and mechanical work [goid 7517] [pmid 7550355] [evidence TAS]; Any process that modulates the frequency, rate or extent of attachment of a cell to another cell or to the extracellular matrix [goid 30155] [evidence IEA]; Any process that modulates the frequency, rate or extent of cell migration [goid 30334] [evidence IEA]; Any process that activates, maintains or increases the frequency, rate or extent of cholinergic synaptic transmission, the process of communication from a neuron to another neuron across a synapse using the neurotransmitter acetylcholine [goid 32224] [evidence IEA]; Any process that modulates the frequency, rate or extent of embryonic development [goid 45995] [evidence IEA]","Interacting selectively with one or more specific sites on a receptor molecule, a macromolecule that undergoes combination with a hormone, neurotransmitter, drug or intracellular messenger to initiate a change in cell function [goid 5102] [evidence IEA]; Interacting selectively with one or more specific sites on a receptor molecule, a macromolecule that undergoes combination with a hormone, neurotransmitter, drug or intracellular messenger to initiate a change in cell function [goid 5102] [evidence IEA]; Interacting selectively with one or more specific sites on a receptor molecule, a macromolecule that undergoes combination with a hormone, neurotransmitter, drug or intracellular messenger to initiate a change in cell function [goid 5102] [evidence IEA]; The action of a molecule that contributes to the structural integrity of a complex or assembly within or outside a cell [goid 5198] [pmid 2185464] [evidence TAS]","LAMM","LAMM","ILMN_1788019",-0.00991640697433736,-0.0170879669066197,-0.0149918770791574,0.252531772165643,0.0318729193317502,4.26029495686959e-06,0,0.808728160438962,0.349941049149133,0.00136786299197439,TRUE,TRUE,-0.347074244101808,-0.598078841731691,-1.04943139554102,-1.04943139554102,0.00136786299197439,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
