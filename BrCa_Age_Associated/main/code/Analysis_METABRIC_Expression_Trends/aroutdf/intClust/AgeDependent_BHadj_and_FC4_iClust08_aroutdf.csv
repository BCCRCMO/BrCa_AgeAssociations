The skeleton is the bony framework of the body in vertebrates (endoskeleton) or the hard outer envelope of insects (exoskeleton or dermoskeleton) [goid 1501] [pmid 9008714] [evidence IDA]; The process whose specific outcome is the progression of an osteoblast over time, from its formation to the mature structure. Osteoblast development does not include the steps involved in committing a cranial neural crest cell or an osteoprogenitor cell to an osteoblast fate. An osteoblast is a cell that gives rise to bone [goid 2076] [evidence IEA]; The series of molecular signals generated as a consequence of a G-protein coupled receptor binding to its physiological ligand, followed by activation of adenylyl cyclase and a subsequent increase in the concentration of cyclic AMP [goid 7189] [pmid 9832460] [evidence IDA]; Any process that mediates the transfer of information from one cell to another [goid 7267] [pmid 2549037] [evidence TAS]; The set of physiological processes that allow an embryo or foetus to develop within the body of a female animal. It covers the time from fertilization of a female ovum by a male spermatozoon until birth [goid 7565] [pmid 10828849] [evidence TAS]; The secretion of milk by the mammary gland [goid 7595] [evidence IEA]; Any process that activates or increases the rate or extent of cell proliferation [goid 8284] [pmid 10773581] [evidence TAS]; Any process that stops, prevents or reduces the rate or extent of cell proliferation [goid 8285] [pmid 8058749] [evidence TAS]; The process whose specific outcome is the progression of the epidermis over time, from its formation to the mature structure. The epidermis is the outer epithelial layer of a plant or animal, it may be a single layer that produces an extracellular material (e.g. the cuticle of arthropods) or a complex stratified squamous epithelium, as in the case of many vertebrate species [goid 8544] [pmid 8058749] [evidence TAS]; The process whereby a relatively unspecialized cell acquires specialized features of an epithelial cell, any of the cells making up an epithelium [goid 30855] [evidence IEA]; Any process involved in the maintenance of an equilibrium of the surface-active lipoprotein mixture which coats the alveoli [goid 43129] [evidence IEA]; The chemical reactions and pathways involving the nucleotide cAMP (cyclic AMP, adenosine 3',5'-cyclophosphate) [goid 46058] [pmid 2549037] [evidence TAS]; The process whose specific outcome is the progression of the alveolus over time, from its formation to the mature structure. The alveolus is a sac for holding air in the lungs; formed by the terminal dilation of air passageways [goid 48286] [evidence IEA]","The action characteristic of a hormone, any substance formed in very small amounts in one specialized organ or group of cells and carried (sometimes in the bloodstream) to another organ or group of cells in the same organism, upon which it has a specific regulatory action. The term was originally applied to agents with a stimulatory physiological action in vertebrate animals (as opposed to a chalone, which has a depressant action). Usage is now extended to regulatory compounds in lower animals and plants, and to synthetic substances having comparable effects [goid 5179] [pmid 2708388] [evidence TAS]; Interacting selectively with calcium ions (Ca2+) [goid 5509] [evidence IEA]","PTHRP; PLP; MGC14611; PTHR; HHM","PTHRP; PLP; MGC14611; PTHR; HHM","ILMN_2314169",-0.0646038176365493,-0.00776381267632614,-0.031078495468369,0.0168062587421648,0.53923619452484,9.76135254643956e-06,0,0.822242762500067,0.933816957556192,0.00158266873197306,TRUE,TRUE,-2.26113361727922,-0.271733443671415,-2.17549468278583,-2.17549468278583,0.00158266873197306,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE
