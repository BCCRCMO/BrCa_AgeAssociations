The Golgi apparatus differs from the endoplasmic reticulum in often having slightly thicker membranes, appearing in sections as a characteristic shallow semicircle so that the convex side (cis or entry face) abuts the endoplasmic reticulum, secretory vesicles emerging from the concave side (trans or exit face). In vertebrate cells there is usually one such organelle, while in invertebrates and plants, where they are known usually as dictyosomes, there may be several scattered in the cytoplasm. The Golgi apparatus processes proteins produced on the ribosomes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum; such processing includes modification of the core oligosaccharides of glycoproteins, and the sorting and packaging of proteins for transport to a variety of cellular locations. Three different regions of the Golgi are now recognized both in terms of structure and function: cis, in the vicinity of the cis face, trans, in the vicinity of the trans face, and medial, lying between the cis and trans regions [goid 5794] [pmid 18029348] [evidence IDA]; Any of the various filamentous elements that form the internal framework of cells, and typically remain after treatment of the cells with mild detergent to remove membrane constituents and soluble components of the cytoplasm.

The Golgi apparatus differs from the endoplasmic reticulum in often having slightly thicker membranes, appearing in sections as a characteristic shallow semicircle so that the convex side (cis or entry face) abuts the endoplasmic reticulum, secretory vesicles emerging from the concave side (trans or exit face). In vertebrate cells there is usually one such organelle, while in invertebrates and plants, where they are known usually as dictyosomes, there may be several scattered in the cytoplasm. The Golgi apparatus processes proteins produced on the ribosomes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum; such processing includes modification of the core oligosaccharides of glycoproteins, and the sorting and packaging of proteins for transport to a variety of cellular locations. Three different regions of the Golgi are now recognized both in terms of structure and function: cis, in the vicinity of the cis face, trans, in the vicinity of the trans face, and medial, lying between the cis and trans regions [goid 5794] [evidence IEA]; Double layer of lipid molecules that encloses all cells, and, in eukaryotes, many organelles; may be a single or double lipid bilayer; also includes associated proteins [goid 16020] [evidence IEA]; Penetrating at least one phospholipid bilayer of a membrane.

An organ is defined as a tissue or set of tissues that work together to perform a specific function or functions. Morphogenesis is the process by which anatomical structures are generated and organized. Organs are commonly observed as visibly distinct structures, but may also exist as loosely associated clusters of cells that work together to perform a specific function or functions [goid 9887] [pmid 9171830] [evidence TAS]; The series of events by which a mechanical stimulus is received by a cell and converted into a molecular signal [goid 50982] [evidence IEA]","Interacting selectively with calcium ions (Ca2+) [goid 5509] [evidence IEA]; Catalysis of facilitated diffusion of an ion (by an energy-independent process) by passage through a transmembrane aqueous pore or channel without evidence for a carrier-mediated mechanism [goid 5216] [evidence IEA]; Catalysis of the transmembrane transfer of a chloride ion by a voltage-gated channel [goid 5247] [pmid 8650545] [evidence TAS]; Catalysis of the transmembrane transfer of a sodium ion by a voltage-gated channel [goid 5248] [pmid 8650545] [evidence TAS]; Interacting selectively with calcium ions (Ca2+) [goid 5509] [pmid 8650545] [evidence TAS]; Interacting selectively with a protein C-terminus, the end of any peptide chain at which the 1-carboxy function of a constituent amino acid is not attached in peptide linkage to another amino-acid residue [goid 8022] [pmid 9171830] [evidence TAS]; Interacting selectively with any protein component of any cytoskeleton (actin, microtubule, or intermediate filament cytoskeleton) [goid 8092] [pmid 10760273] [evidence TAS]","PKD4; PC2; APKD2; MGC138468; MGC138466","PC2; PKD4; APKD2; MGC138468; MGC138466","ILMN_2052891",-0.0167664641743083,-0.00333626837341144,-0.00937353423934648,0.0350423737016064,0.476654894187675,6.27508395275164e-05,0,0.86334008602145,0.919826963418559,0.00595803350478868,TRUE,TRUE,-0.586826246100789,-0.1167693930694,-0.656147396754253,-0.656147396754253,0.00595803350478868,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

In vertebrate cells there is usually one such organelle, while in invertebrates and plants, where they are known usually as dictyosomes, there may be several scattered in the cytoplasm. The Golgi apparatus processes proteins produced on the ribosomes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum; such processing includes modification of the core oligosaccharides of glycoproteins, and the sorting and packaging of proteins for transport to a variety of cellular locations. Three different regions of the Golgi are now recognized both in terms of structure and function: cis, in the vicinity of the cis face, trans, in the vicinity of the trans face, and medial, lying between the cis and trans regions [goid 5794] [evidence IEA]",NA,"Interacting selectively with a lipid [goid 8289] [evidence IEA]","dJ776F14.1; UBX1; UBXD10; p47; MGC3347","dJ776F14.1; UBX1; UBXD10; p47; MGC3347","ILMN_1657624",0.00481095132312608,0.00363224484696386,0.00680267818358115,0.419994225780227,0.290584245402564,8.66207079943087e-05,0,0.945700887502003,0.857658477676524,0.00739047274868225,TRUE,TRUE,0.168383296309413,0.127128569643735,0.476187472850681,0.476187472850681,0.00739047274868225,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE

The Golgi apparatus differs from the endoplasmic reticulum in often having slightly thicker membranes, appearing in sections as a characteristic shallow semicircle so that the convex side (cis or entry face) abuts the endoplasmic reticulum, secretory vesicles emerging from the concave side (trans or exit face). In vertebrate cells there is usually one such organelle, while in invertebrates and plants, where they are known usually as dictyosomes, there may be several scattered in the cytoplasm. The Golgi apparatus processes proteins produced on the ribosomes of the rough endoplasmic reticulum; such processing includes modification of the core oligosaccharides of glycoproteins, and the sorting and packaging of proteins for transport to a variety of cellular locations. Three different regions of the Golgi are now recognized both in terms of structure and function: cis, in the vicinity of the cis face, trans, in the vicinity of the trans face, and medial, lying between the cis and trans regions [goid 5794] [evidence IEA]; The network of interconnected tubular and cisternal structures located at the side of the Golgi apparatus distal to the endoplasmic reticulum, from which secretory vesicles emerge.
